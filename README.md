# Target-Game
Extremely Simple Game working on learning SFML and different types of c++ libraries.  The program starts by creating a SFML window then the target is on the top of the window going from to left to right.  The user plays by clicking left on the mouse and the ball shoots trying to hit the target. When the ball collides with either the target or the upper bound of the window it resets to the window.  The ball continaully follows the users mouse.
